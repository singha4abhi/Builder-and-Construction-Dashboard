# Case Study
# Introduction
Vijay Construction is a prominent Malaysia-based infrastructure services provider specializing in projects such as viaducts, flyovers, metros, bridges, pipelines, roads, ports, and more. To effectively monitor and manage their diverse range of infrastructure projects, Vijay Construction initiated a Business Intelligence (BI) project. Their primary goal was to track the status of ongoing projects using data from Postgres SQL and Excel sources.
# Business Objective
 The key objectives of Vijay Construction’s BI project were as follows:

**Project Status Tracking:** Develop a system to monitor the status of their various infrastructure projects.

**Data Visualization:** Create informative reports to track Total Activities, Total Critical Activities, Project Delays, Milestones, and other key performance indicators.

**Drill-Down Capability:** Implement slicers and filters to enable users to drill down into project data based on different time frames, such as date and month.
# Data Collection and Integration

**Data Sources:** Primary source – Postgres SQL, Supplementary source – Excel.

**Data Integration:** Power BI used for data integration and visualization.

**Data Transformation:** SQL employed for data retrieval and transformation from Postgres SQL.
